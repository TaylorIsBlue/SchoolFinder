# School Finder

A simple React JS App that looks for schools around a property. Provides information about the known schools within a certain area with Overpass API.

## Features
- Search for a certain type of school with filters (Primary, Secondary, Tertriary)
- Provide a radius/distance to search for.
- Search in Kilometers, a widely used metric system.
- Simple and quick searching, google won't provide you this quick information with one search like this would.
- No bloat, this program is simple and straight forward.

## To Do:
-  Property Information (Google?) (Need to find a API)
-  Light/Dark Mode Toggle

## How To Run
Fork this repo, then:
In one terminal:
```
cd backend
node index.js
```
In another terminal:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Disclaimer
This is a project that I made simply because I was bored, bugs, errors, etc are unlikely since its so simple. If there are any bugs, they are 99% most likely fixable (esaily of course) if you _need_ to use this site.
